## Deployment priority of public charging speeds for increasing battery electric vehicle usability

To inform charger deployment decisions, this paper aims to understand the potential utilization
and deployment priority for public charging infrastructure. A data-driven Cumulative Public
Recharging (CPR) model is developed to explore the travel patterns by using 2017 National
Household Travel Survey data. Given the daily trip sequence, trip distance, and dwell times, the
study examines the daily expected driving range and BEV feasibility under different charging
speeds, battery capacity, and charging behaviors. The results suggest that more advanced public
chargers increase the daily expected driving range. Home charging is sufficient for most daily
short-distance trips while public chargers are still needed for medium- and long-distance trips.
Extreme fast charging (xFC) may not be necessary for people with home charging but could be
more useful for people without home charging and for urgent charging. xFC becomes even less
important to drivers with longer BEV ranges, a finding that contradicts conventional thinking.
